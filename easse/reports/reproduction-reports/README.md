# EASSE test sets reports
This directory contains the EASSE reports for all reproduced models on all available German test sets. 
The reports were generated using the following settings:

- lowercasing: False
- tokenizer: spacy
- metrics: bleu,sari,bertscore,fre,wiener_sachtextformel_1
- language:de

We removed the system generation on those test sets which have a restricted license.
